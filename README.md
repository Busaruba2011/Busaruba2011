### Hey guys, I'm Busaruba!

<My name is pronounced 'buz-a-rubber'. I like coding and game development. I got into it because I love gaming and decided to try and make my own games. I didn't publish them (exept 2 I don't update). The usernames I use are: Busaruba, busaruba, Busaruba2011, Busaruba2605 and busarubayo.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lots of things.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Unity
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making an updater for my programs and games
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about things I like
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, him, Bus, them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I came up with the name Busaruba when I was 7! I just made it up

Have a good day and cya all later!
